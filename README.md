# Storm_Data

Storms in the United States can cause damage, I know that is not a particularly interesting statement but it is true nonetheless. In this repo, I attempt to examine
and visualize the effects 

# Lanugages Used: 
- R 
- R Markdown 

# R packages: 
- ggplot2
- dplyr

# Notes: 

After being somewhat unsatisfied with answering two basic questions: which storms cause the most economic harm & which storms are the most injurious to public health; 
I know that there is alot more exploring and analysis to be done on this dataset. Primarily, this data can be better visualized in Tableau (soon to come), with maps and charts
that answer more interesting questions. 

Further, it stands to reason that we can deploy a predictive model to accurately predict the devistation of a particular storm. This can be done natively in R. 
Alternatively, a model can be developed using SciKit-Learn or TensorFlow [Python].
